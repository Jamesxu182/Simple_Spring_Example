## Spring Basic Example

* Introduction

  This project is a example for basic building of spring & J2EE environment and usage of Spring Framework. It also a very basic and foundational code that you may learn previously. Hope you like it and could get some inspiration from it.

  The Spring Framework is a kind of specific and unique web application for J2EE. There are many features and characteristics that rarely appear in other framework, such as IoC(Inversion of Control), DI(dependency Injection) and AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming). you may confuse about the concept but don't be afraid, hope you find it out with this example.

* Programming and Technique
  1. Java 2 Enterprise Edition(J2EE)

  2. Spring Framework 4

  3. Maven

* Tools

  1. eclipse J2EE

  2. m2eclipse for Maven(eclipse plugin)

  3. SpringIDE for Spring Framework(eclipse plugin)

* Implementation

  1. Router
    Show Dynamic JSP(Java Server Page) with particular URL from browser.

    [http://localhost:8080/test](http://localhost:8080/test)

  2. POST Form Parse
    There are form in test page and you could input anything you want in the text bar and submit it. it will send to controller for parsing.

  3. Parameter transmition
    The content that the user input will be passed to another page. And it will show you the processing of transmiting the parameter from controller to web page(JSP) and show it with EL(Expression Language)

  * Usage, Building & Testing

  This is a executable projection. you could build it with Maven and I provide a pom.xml configure file to help you do this.

  By the way, if you have never hear about Maven, you could click the link below.

  [Maven Home Page](https://maven.apache.org/)

  It will help you to install required components, like tomcat and spring. you could also build and test the project with it.

  finally, run your tomcat and see the demo from browser with local URL.

  [Local URL](http://localhost:8080/test)

  * Misc

    Thank you for your attention. Really looking forward your advice and thought.
